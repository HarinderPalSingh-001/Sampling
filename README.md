Approaching Sample Selection: A Continuum of Options

To provide more insight into our analysis, we generated additional samples using a series of techniques:

Simple Random Sampling (Sample 1): A standard strategy in which data points are chosen randomly — like drawing lottery numbers. Bootstrap Sampling (Sample 2): A resampling method where a data point can be selected multiple times, i.e., it's like you draw from the hat where some data points are just present more than once and put the sample back into the hat. Sample 3: Cluster Sampling — This method involves grouping data points into clusters and collecting an entire representative sample from each cluster. Now imagine dividing a population up into neighborhoods and sampling people from each. Systematic Sampling (Sample 4): This sampling method involves selecting data points at regular intervals, providing a coverage of the entire dataset. Scheduling names out of a phonebook like every few minutes Stratified Sampling (Sample 5): Ensures proportional class representation in sample, maintaining the same class distribution as the original dataset. Тrening the Champions: Model Selectio

All five models put on their training hats and were tested on each of the autogeneratd samples. Their relative performance was measured using that old faithful metric, accuracy.

Results: Discovering Model Behavior

So, here is accuracy across the samples per model:

Insights and Observations

Consistent Performers:

Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors show exceptional stability in their results across the samples. They appear to be robust against which sampling method is used.

Accuracy Aces:

The Decision Tree and Random Forest should be the clear front-runners of this dataset, with really excellent accuracy scores. Well, they can model complex relationships in the data.

SVM's Selective Brilliance:

Support Vector Machine has some sample-to-sample variation in accuracy. My point is that it seems a little sensitive to the nature of the sampled data.

The Road Ahead

So far, we have gained a lot of insight into how the model behaves with varying sampling conditions. Additional investigation might include:

Hyperparameter Tuning:

If the hyperparameters of each model for each sample are finely-tuned, even better performance might be achieved.

Feature Engineering:

New features from existing ones help define better models in a process called Feature Engineering.

Error Analysis:

Understanding the nature of each model’s mistakes can point the way to further gains. It is through these extra trips that we can improve our models and collect data that is more meaningful.
